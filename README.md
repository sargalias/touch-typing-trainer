# Touch typing trainer with custom text

## Description  
The unique thing about this program is that it allows you to practice touch typing with the **text you load into it**. You can get any text, including thousands of literary classics available on the public domain. Then the program will have you type all of it out, while highlighting any mistakes you make.

I created this program because I wanted to actually enjoy reading what I typed, rather than just doing exercises with random passages and phrases.

This is the first program I ever created, back when I was first learning python. As such, please note that it is a primitive program, but it works.

## Running the program  
To run, first load up your text in the file **text.txt**. Spaces and paragraph breaks are allowed.  
To change what _line number_ you are on, you can change it in the file **user-settings.txt**.  
Run the file **typing.py** with python from the **home directory of the program**.

## Usage and commands
**Esc**: Closes the program.  
**Arrow keys**: Progresses the text and overwrites mistakes. For example pressing the down arrow key will take you to the next line, and remove any mistakes that you have made so far.


## Tips
Accuracy is more important than speed. When practicing, it's better to go slow and not make mistakes, than to go fast and make mistakes. Speed comes relatively easily, but accuracy doesn't.

## Warnings and notes
- Don't move any files or rename them.
- You can't go back a page, unless you change your line number in the **user-settings.txt** file.
- The text can sometimes temporarily change position as you type it.
- If you make a mistake, the text will stay highlighted as red and all further text will be highlighted as red. This is to enforce accuracy.
